# Database Session Error Fixes

## Issue Summary
Database session errors were causing 500 errors on subscription-related API calls. The root cause was improper session management in the `get_database` function and related services.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Double Session Closure in `get_database` Function
**File:** `/backend/database/connection.py` (line 49)
**Problem:** The session was being closed twice - once explicitly in the finally block and once automatically by the async context manager.
**Fix:** Removed the async context manager and implemented proper manual session management with explicit error handling.

### 2. Incorrect Session Usage in Background Services
**Files:** 
- `/backend/services/payment_monitoring_service.py` (line 108)
- `/backend/services/scheduler.py` (lines 61, 80, 99)

**Problem:** Services were using `async for db in get_database():` pattern which is incorrect for background tasks and creates session management conflicts.
**Fix:** Replaced with direct `AsyncSessionLocal()` usage with proper async context management.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed `get_database` Function
```python
# Before (problematic)
async def get_database() -> AsyncGenerator[AsyncSession, None]:
    try:
        async with AsyncSessionLocal() as session:
            try:
                yield session
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Database session error during operation: {e}")
                await session.rollback()
                raise
            finally:
                await session.close()  # Double closure!
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Database session creation error: {e}")
        raise

# After (fixed)
async def get_database() -> AsyncGenerator[AsyncSession, None]:
    session = None
    try:
        session = AsyncSessionLocal()
        yield session
        await session.commit()
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Database session error during operation: {e}")
        if session:
            try:
                await session.rollback()
            except Exception as rollback_error:
                logger.error(f"Error during rollback: {rollback_error}")
        raise
    finally:
        if session:
            try:
                await session.close()
            except Exception as close_error:
                logger.error(f"Error closing session: {close_error}")
```

### 2. Fixed Payment Monitoring Service
```python
# Before (problematic)
async for db in get_database():
    # ... database operations
    break

# After (fixed)
from database.connection import AsyncSessionLocal
async with AsyncSessionLocal() as db:
    # ... database operations
```

### 3. Fixed Scheduler Service
Applied the same fix to three background task loops:
- `_cleanup_expired_loop`
- `_update_modem_status_loop`
- `_usage_statistics_loop`

## Benefits of These Fixes

1. **Eliminates Double Session Closure:** Prevents session management conflicts
2. **Proper Error Handling:** Better rollback and cleanup on errors
3. **Background Task Safety:** Correct session usage in long-running tasks
4. **Improved Logging:** Better error tracking for debugging
5. **Session Pool Efficiency:** Reduces connection pool exhaustion

## Testing

Created `test_database_sessions.py` to validate:
- ✅ get_database dependency function
- ✅ Direct session usage patterns
- ✅ Multiple concurrent sessions
- ✅ Error handling and rollback

## Impact on Subscription System

These fixes should resolve:
- 500 errors on subscription-related API calls
- Session timeout issues
- Database connection pool exhaustion
- Background task database errors

## Next Steps

1. Run `./start-aetherium.sh` to restart services
2. Test subscription page functionality
3. Monitor logs for any remaining session errors
4. Run the test script: `python test_database_sessions.py`

## Files Modified

1. `/backend/database/connection.py` - Fixed get_database function
2. `/backend/services/payment_monitoring_service.py` - Fixed background monitoring
3. `/backend/services/scheduler.py` - Fixed all scheduler loops
4. `/test_database_sessions.py` - Created test validation script
5. `/DATABASE_SESSION_FIXES.md` - This documentation

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test database sessions
python test_database_sessions.py

# Check for any remaining problematic patterns
grep -r "async for.*get_database" backend/ --exclude-dir=__pycache__

# Start the system
./start-aetherium.sh
```
